## About the project

The idea of â€‹â€‹the project is to be a promotional site for the movie Doctor Strange: Multiverse of Madness.

On this site the user could see the movie trailer, synopsis, which characters would be in the movie, what their powers are and which comics they are in.
The entire project from idea to design was developed by me.

Access to site: https://doctor-strange.vercel.app/ <br/>
